**Description** 

Wadstagram, photo-sharing service that enables its users to upload, comment and like pictures.

**Implemented use cases**

- Creating an account and logging in
- Uploading an image
- Adding a comment on an image
- Liking an image
- User profiles

**Not implemented**
- Following users

Note: Lack of comments in the code is due to us estimating that an informed reader should be able to understand the code without them. Methods are rather aptly named and should carry their function well enough as the complexity of the actual code is rather trivial.
